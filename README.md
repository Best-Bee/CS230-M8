Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

They were a company outsourcing their project of expanding their current game to other systems, at first they only had it available for Android and wished to expand to other systems. They wanted us to design software to allow for play between multiple operating systems.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did the evaluation section quite well, rather than just covering the advantages of each one I also added some prominent disadvantages (I did exclude anything that was benign enough to not be one or the other).

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think working through stuff like this can be very helpful when you are unsure of where exactly to start, having this information available helps determine the best choice when it comes to this (such as which compatibility you wish to develop first).

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would personally revise the recommendation section, what I wrote for it just feels shallow to me and I feel that I could've given a much more in depth recommendation that properly highlights more than just basic information about each thing I recommended.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user should have a good experience overall, the primary point in time where I considered this had to do with loading data (mainly pre-loading) to allow for the user to experience as little lag while playing as possible. Things like this are important because if the software isn't nice to use then generally people will be less likely to use it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I would likely follow a similar format to this document while modifying the sections to better fit what I need to cover in it. For this document I mainly used information I already knew at the time of writing but in the future I'll probably do a lot more research for each section to provide a more comprehensive document.
